    "### Introduction to Keras Tuner\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras Tuner is a powerful tool for hyperparameter tuning in Keras models. Hyperparameter tuning is the process of searching for the optimal set of hyperparameters (parameters that govern the training process) for a machine learning model. This process is crucial because the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Can Be Tuned?\n",
    "\n",
    "With Keras Tuner, you can tune virtually any aspect of a model. Common hyperparameters include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learning Rate:** One of the most critical hyperparameters for training neural networks.\n",
    "2. **Number of Layers:** The depth of the network.\n",
    "3. **Number of Neurons in Each Layer:** Influences the model's capacity.\n",
    "4. **Activation Functions:** Such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.\n",
    "5. **Batch Size:** Number of samples processed before the model is updated.\n",
    "6. **Optimizer:** Such as Adam, SGD, etc.\n",
    "7. **Dropout Rate:** Used in dropout layers to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Tuners Available\n",
    "\n",
    "Keras Tuner offers several algorithms for hyperparameter optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Search:** Randomly selects a combination of hyperparameters to construct a model. This method is simple and can be surprisingly effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hyperband:** An optimized version of random search which uses a bandit-based approach to allocate resources. It's more efficient as it early-stops underperforming trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bayesian Optimization:** Uses probability to model the function and then makes decisions on where to sample next. It’s more systematic compared to random search and often yields better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sklearn:** If you are using Keras models with the Scikit-learn API, this tuner adapts the hyperparameter search to this interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Hyperparameter Tuning with Fashion MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fashion MNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll demo the hyperparameter tuning using the Fashion MNIST data.\n"

Since `overwrite=True`, the my_rnd_search directory is deleted before training starts. If you run this code a second time but with `overwrite=False` and `max_tri⁠als=10`, the tuner will continue tuning where it left off, running 5 more trials: this means you don’t have to run all the trials in one shot.

    "### Guide on Selecting Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the right hyperparameters is crucial for training effective neural network models. Here's a quick guide covering key hyperparameters, along with rules of thumb and intuitions for training:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Number of Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General Rule:** Start with one or two hidden layers for simple problems. For more complex problems, gradually increase the number of layers.\n",
    "- **Deep Networks:** More layers allow the network to learn more complex patterns (hierarchical feature learning). However, deeper networks are harder to train and more prone to overfitting.\n",
    "- **Transfer Learning:** Re-using hidden layers from a pre-trained model can significantly boost performance, especially when data is limited. This is effective when the new task is similar to the task originally trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Number of Neurons per Hidden Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size Configurations:** Often configured in a funnel shape (e.g., decreasing number of neurons in each successive layer).\n",
    "- **Capacity of the Model:** More neurons increase the learning capacity but can lead to overfitting and longer training times.\n",
    "- **Rule of Thumb:** A common practice is to use a number of neurons that is between the number of input and output neurons, experimenting with values to find the optimal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Learning Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact:** One of the most critical hyperparameters. Too low, and training will be slow; too high, and the network may not converge.\n",
    "- **Adaptive Learning Rates:** Techniques like learning rate annealing (gradually reducing the learning rate) can be very effective.\n",
    "- **Optimization Techniques:** Upcoming topics like learning rate schedules and adaptive learning rate methods (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) offer more nuanced control.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role of Optimizer:** Determines how the network will be updated based on the loss gradient. It affects the speed and quality of the learning process.\n",
    "- **Choices:** Common optimizers include SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent), Adam, RMSprop. Adam is a good default choice, as it combines the benefits of other extensions of SGD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Batch Size\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trade-offs:** Larger batches provide more accurate estimates of the gradient, but smaller batches offer a regularizing effect and less stable, noisier updates, which can help escape local minima.\n",
    "- **Hardware Constraints:** Limited by memory constraints. Larger batches require more memory.\n",
    "- **Typical Values:** Common batch sizes range from 32 to 256, but the optimal size depends on the specific problem and hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Activation Function\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-linearity:** Functions like ReLU (and its variants like Leaky ReLU) are common because they help with faster training and reduce the likelihood of vanishing gradients in deep networks.\n",
    "- **Problem Specific:** For the output layer, use softmax for multi-class classification and sigmoid for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. Number of Iterations and Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epochs vs. Iterations:** An epoch is a complete pass over the entire training dataset, while an iteration is a single update of the model's parameters.\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:** A technique to prevent overfitting by stopping training when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade.\n",
    "- **Monitoring Performance:** Adjust the number of epochs based on monitoring performance metrics on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting hyperparameters is often more art than science, requiring experimentation and iteration. It's common to start with certain defaults and adjust based on the specific problem and observed performance. Transfer learning, adaptive learning rates, and early stopping are advanced strategies that can significantly improve model performance and training efficiency. Remember, the goal is to find a balance that allows the network to learn effectively without overfitting, underfitting, or requiring excessive computational resources."
