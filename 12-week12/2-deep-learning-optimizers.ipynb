    "## Training: Optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Optimizers in Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizers in neural networks are algorithms or methods used to change the attributes of the neural network such as weights and learning rate in order to reduce the losses. Optimization algorithms guide the training process towards the direction of minimum loss, or in other words, the best set of weights that represent the relationship between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation and Intuition Behind Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Optimization Matters:** The core objective of a neural network is to find the best possible values for its weights that minimize the loss function, leading to more accurate predictions. Optimization algorithms are the tools that make this search efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** \n",
    "  - **Basic Concept:** SGD is the foundation of neural network optimization. It updates the weights incrementally after each iteration over a batch, using the gradient of the loss function.\n",
    "  - **Process:** SGD computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights for a small set of random samples (mini-batch), then updates the weights in the opposite direction of the gradient.\n",
    "  - **Limitation:** While simple and effective, SGD can be slow and inefficient, especially in cases of irregular cost functions (e.g., with many local minima, plateaus, or high curvature). It also treats all directions in the parameter space uniformly, not accounting for possible variations in the landscape of the cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Building on SGD\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced optimization algorithms build on the idea of SGD but incorporate additional mechanisms to address its limitations, like slow convergence and sensitivity to the choice of the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Momentum Optimization:** Adds a notion of \"inertia\" to the SGD, helping to accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampen oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG):** A variation of momentum optimization that measures the gradient of the cost function not at the current weights but slightly ahead in the direction of the momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AdaGrad:** Adapts the learning rate to the parameters, allowing for larger updates for infrequent and smaller updates for frequent parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **RMSProp:** Adjusts the method of adapting the learning rate, resolving some issues of AdaGrad in long-running scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adam Optimization:** Combines the ideas of momentum optimization and RMSProp, adding bias correction and adaptive learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these optimizers modifies the basic SGD approach to improve training speed, convergence reliability, and adaptability to complex landscapes of the cost function.\n"

    "### Momentum Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum optimization is a technique that builds upon Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to accelerate the training process of a neural network, particularly in scenarios where the surface of the objective function has different curvatures in different dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a ball rolling down a hill. As it rolls, it accumulates momentum (speed), allowing it to move faster and also to overcome obstacles or small bumps (local minima) more effectively. In the context of neural network training, momentum optimization mimics this behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "SGD makes small steps towards the minimum, it can often get stuck in local minima or take a long time if the surface is flat. Momentum optimization helps to accelerate SGD by moving faster along the directions of the persistent reduction in the cost function (like the downhill direction in our analogy) and dampens the oscillations in directions where the gradient keeps changing directions (like the bumps or uneven terrain for the ball).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "   - In momentum optimization, the update rule incorporates the concept of 'velocity' (v). The weight update rule is modified as follows:\n",
    "     - $ v \\leftarrow \\beta v - \\eta \\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta) $\n",
    "     - $ \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + v $\n",
    "   - Here, $ \\theta $ represents the weights, $ \\eta $ is the learning rate, $ \\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta) $ is the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights, and $ \\beta $ is the momentum hyperparameter (typically set between 0.9 and 0.99).\n",
    "   - $ v $ is the velocity term, and $ \\beta $ controls how much of the previous update is added to the current update.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretation:**\n",
    "   - The term $ \\beta v $ adds a fraction of the previous update to the current update. This fraction is controlled by the hyperparameter $ \\beta $, known as the momentum factor.\n",
    "   - High values of $ \\beta $ provide more momentum, speeding up the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Benefits of Momentum Optimization:**\n",
    "   - **Faster Convergence:** By accumulating momentum, the optimizer can traverse the parameter space faster than basic SGD, leading to quicker convergence.\n",
    "   - **Smoothing Effect:** It helps in smoothing out the updates, which is beneficial in scenarios where the cost function has a lot of local minima, sharp curvatures, or gentle slopes.\n",
    "   - **Responsiveness:** It remains responsive to changes by considering the most recent gradients, allowing it to navigate the cost function more effectively."

Imagine if the ball had a clear view of where it’s heading and could adjust its path proactively rather than just reactively. Essentially, this is what NAG does compared to standard momentum optimization. \n",

    "\n",
    "The $ \\infty $-norm, also known as the infinity norm or maximum norm, is a specific way to measure the size (or length) of a vector. It is defined as the maximum absolute value of its elements. Mathematically, for a vector $ \\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n] $, the $ \\infty $-norm is given by:\n",

In optimization, this means the updates are driven primarily by the dimension with the highest gradient, providing a form of robustness against transient or anomalous components in the gradient vector.\n",

    "### Nadam Optimization (Nesterov-accelerated Adaptive Moment Estimation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nadam optimization is an advanced gradient descent algorithm that combines elements from both the Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) and Adam optimization methods, aiming to leverage the benefits of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the navigation analogy, if Adam optimization is akin to a sophisticated GPS system that adjusts your path based on recent terrain (gradients) and momentum (direction and speed of past movements), Nadam adds an additional layer of foresight. It's like looking further down the road to anticipate future changes in the terrain, allowing for more proactive adjustments in your path. This foresight comes from the Nesterov technique, which effectively predicts where parameters might end up in the next step and adjusts the gradients accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Definition and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "   - Nadam combines the Adam update rule with the Nesterov technique. The update rules are modified as follows:\n",
    "     - The moment vectors $ m $ (mean) and $ v $ (uncentered variance) are computed as in Adam.\n",
    "     - The Nesterov update is then applied to the moment vector $ m $:\n",
    "       - $ \\hat{m} = \\frac{m}{1 - \\beta_1^t} $\n",
    "       - $ \\hat{v} = \\frac{v}{1 - \\beta_2^t} $\n",
    "       - The parameters are updated with:\n",
    "         - $ \\theta \\leftarrow \\theta - \\frac{\\eta}{\\sqrt{\\hat{v}} + \\epsilon} (\\beta_1 \\hat{m} + \\frac{(1 - \\beta_1)\\nabla_{\\theta} J(\\theta)}{1 - \\beta_1^t}) $\n",
    "   - Here, $ \\beta_1 $ and $ \\beta_2 $ are the exponential decay rates for the moment estimates, similar to Adam.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Benefits of Nadam:**\n",
    "   - **Incorporates Nesterov Momentum:** Nadam includes the benefits of Nesterov momentum, leading to faster convergence in practice, especially in the face of high curvature or noisy gradients.\n",
    "   - **Adaptive Learning Rates:** Like Adam, it adapts the learning rates based on the history of gradients, making it efficient for a wide range of problems."

    "### AdamW Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "AdamW is a variation of the Adam optimization algorithm, incorporating a modification called \"weight decay.\" It was introduced to address some shortcomings in how the original Adam algorithm integrates L2 regularization, particularly in how it interacts with the adaptive learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight Decay**\n",
    "  - Weight decay is a technique commonly used in training neural networks to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the magnitude of the weights. This penalty discourages the model from having large weights and promotes simpler models.\n",
    "  - In traditional SGD, this is achieved by simply subtracting a portion of the weights at each update (hence the term \"decay\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference from L2 Regularization:**\n",
    "  - While often used interchangeably with L2 regularization, weight decay in the context of AdamW is subtly different. L2 regularization adds a penalty based on the weight values to the loss function, affecting the calculation of gradients. In contrast, weight decay directly adjusts the weights independently of the adaptive learning rate.\n",
    "  - In adaptive learning rate methods like Adam, applying L2 regularization directly can lead to an unintended interplay with the adaptive learning rates, potentially reducing the effectiveness of the regularization. AdamW decouples weight decay from the adaptive learning rate adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "  - In AdamW, the weight decay is applied directly to the weights after the adaptive learning rate step, rather than as part of the gradient:\n",
    "    - After the usual Adam update step (including the computation of adaptive learning rates and application of gradients), the weights are simply adjusted by a factor related to the weight decay coefficient (e.g., they are multiplied by a factor < 1, such as .99)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Role and Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Regularization:** By decoupling weight decay from the gradient updates, AdamW often provides better regularization and generalization performance compared to standard Adam, especially in training deep learning models where overfitting is a concern.\n",
    "- **Maintaining Simplicity:** It helps in keeping the model simpler and less prone to overfitting by penalizing large weights, without conflicting with the benefits of adaptive learning rates."
